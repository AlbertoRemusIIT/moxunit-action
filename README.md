# MOxUnit action

This action performs unit tests for GNU Octave and Matlab using the unit testing framework [MOxUnit](https://github.com/MOxUnit/MOxUnit/blob/master/Makefile).

## Usage

In the simplest case
```
steps:
 - uses: actions/checkout@v2
 - uses: joergbrech/moxunit-action@master
```

runs all MOxUnit test cases found in this repository. A more complex use case could look like this:

```
steps:
- uses: actions/checkout@v2
- uses: joergbrech/moxunit-action@master
  with:
    tests: tests my_extra_testfile.m
    src: src thirdparty util
    with_coverage: true
    doc_tests: true
    cover_xml_file: coverage.xml

```
